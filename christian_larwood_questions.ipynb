On line 4 `Integer#times` is called on the integer 2 and a `do..end` block is passed to it as an argument.

The reason local variable `a` is initialized and not reassigned is because the block parameter, `a`, shares a name with lcoal variable `a` initialized in the outer scope.  This is called variable shadowing and it prevents the block from accessing the variable initialized in the outer scope.  So local variable `a` intiailized on line 1 still points to the integer 4.   On line 6 `#puts` is invoked and the integer referenced by local variable `a` is passed in as an argument.  The `#times` method iterates the block twice, so a string representation of 5 is output twice.  \n",

On line 10 `#puts` is invoked with the integer object referenced by local variable `b` passed in as an argument.   This will output a string representation of 2.  "
