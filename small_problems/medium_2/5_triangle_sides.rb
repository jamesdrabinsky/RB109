=begin
A triangle is classified as follows:

equilateral All 3 sides are of equal length
isosceles 2 sides are of equal length, while the 3rd is different
scalene All 3 sides are of different length
To be a valid triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides must be greater than the length of the longest side, and all sides must have lengths greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

Write a method that takes the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :equilateral, :isosceles, :scalene, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid.

  when values.uniq.size == 2 then :isosceles
  else :scalene
